## RoadRunner

This is a pathing library that is used to move the robot to specific positions on the field
and perform actions at certain positions.

Use [this link](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/tuning) or [watch this](https://youtu.be/efC0H9Twz_8)(Old version so some things might be different) to tune the follower to best fit
the robot's specific properties.

If anything affecting the robot's movement has changed, such as mass, friction, wheels, etc,
it must be retuned or the robot will start moving innacurately.
